ERROR SEEDING BATCH TO CASSANDRA:  { [Error: All host(s) tried for query failed. First host tried, 127.0.0.1:9042: Host considered as DOWN. See innerErrors.]
innerErrors: { '127.0.0.1:9042': 'Host considered as DOWN' },
info: 'Represents an error when a query cannot be performed because no host is available or could be reached by the driver.',
message: 'All host(s) tried for query failed. First host tried, 127.0.0.1:9042: Host considered as DOWN. See innerErrors.' }

Potential Solution:
Spin up cassandra on a different instance. Each server instance will then communicate to the cassandra instance.
if the cassandra instance is still too taxed, spin up additional cassandra instances as nodes in a cluster.
